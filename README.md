# Battery Switch for Tasmota

Batter charger switcher for [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/)

This app keeps battery between 20% and 90% when battery charger is plugged in all the time.

It is useful for android devs (like me) that keeps phones connected, and don't want to have battery
problems (it explodes near my notebook).

## Use case:

Keep phone connected to charger with Tamsmota Power Switch in the middle of charger and phone.

Open the app and setup the tasmota IP or network name.

Put the widget in the screen to monitor the status, adn configure user name password and device id.

Use adb connect through wifi to develop with the phone, and the scrcpy app to control it remotely.
